# 2D Robot Simulator

_Note: This work was part of a practical for the Artificial Intelligence Practice module at the University of St Andrews (CS5011)._

This is a 2 dimensional simulation of a robot with a (sort of) differential drive. The goal of the robot is to reach the yellow dot without crashing into obstacles. Several agent implementations can be chosen. The main focus in this project was the use of Potential Fields for robot navigation.

A report with further details is [included](https://github.com/ischlag/2D-Robot-Simulator/blob/master/Report.pdf).

JTS - Java Topology Suite is used for some calculations (http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/JTSHome.htm)

#Shortcuts:
- r Place robot
- g Place goal 
- o Place obstacle
- m Place moving obstacle 
- s Start/Stop robot
- d Reset robot to starting position 
- c Clear
