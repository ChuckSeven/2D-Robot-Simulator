# 2D Robot Simulator

This is a 2 dimensional simulation of a robot with a (sort of) differential drive. The goal of the robot is to reach the yellow dot without crashing into obstacles. Several agent implementations are given.

A report with further details is provided.

JTS - Java Topology Suite is used for some calculations (http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/JTSHome.htm)

#Shortcuts:
-r Place robot
-g Place goal 
-o Place obstacle
-m Place moving obstacle 
-s Start/Stop robot
-d Reset robot to starting position
